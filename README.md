Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Forum App

This project is developed to help students about their studentship conditions, 
there is three types of problems that students cope with in their life in Turkey,

- First of all, Because of economic conditions, students have a huge difficulty to find a place to stay so the first category helps about this problem
- Second, actually according to first problem, they may need money so the second category helps them advertise their stuff to sell.
- And the third (the last one for now), as a teenager we all have relationship and social life, so third category is the "Addmision", they can talk about
their feelings about their crush or talk about something special in real life.

In the forum system, all students are registered using their student e-mail so, there is no any user can register from the outside of the university.

Their completely anonim on the system they have username and they login the system using their usernames.

Development Still in progress this code works and application can be used but there is some little requirements for the forum
system. It is not completed yet.

In this system i experienced very important situations and errors for real time database and states for javascript. So i need to improve myself
by developing more complicated and large scale projects. 

In addition to that, because of university education, development of this project is a bit interrupted but on the other hand i developed myself
and learnt new tecnologies about back-end (Spring Framework) and APIs so that gave me a good perspective about using these technologies in also my mobile apps
i will be able to create a communication between more than one type of devices according to manage data and show the same data to customers.

(I share all of my projects in public because i strongly believe that it is the only way that the community can be 
developed. This project is planned to be released into the mobile stores in the future, it will be developed and the system
will be enlarged.)

Used Technologies

-Java Script - React native 
-Firebase - Firestore, Auth 

(As i mentioned it still has some lacks but it will be solved and done in the near future)
